                                The Global Positioning system (GPS) is a satellite based 
                                positioning system operated by the U.S Department of Defence 
                                (DoD). When fully operated, GPS will produce all-weather 
                                worldwide, 24-hour position and time information.
                            </p>

                            <br />

                            <p>
                                GPS allows collection of accurate, up-to-date data when and 
                                where you need it, at relatively low cost. With GPS mapping tools 
                                you can define a data dictionary and collect attributes in the 
                                field at the same time as position data is collected. This is fast, 
                                eliminates transcription errors, and ensure that the information 
                                in your database is current.
